# Turns the screen on and off. Every screen is diffrent and many are bad programmed
# for that here are two diffrent ways for turning it on and off.
function screen(){

		vcgencmd display_power 1 >/dev/null
		
		# Version 2: send cec-signal to the screen that he should wake up
		#echo on 0 | cec-client -s -d 1

		# Version 2b: if the screen turns on but at wrong input (e.g. AV1) force it to
		# switch to HDMI1 port. This works only if the screen is on already
		# therefore send it a few times in a row. 4F:82:10:00 is HDMI1, 4F:82:20:00
		# is HDMI2, 4F:82:30:00 is HDMI3 and so on. Attention this is an unoffical
		# cec-signal which may not work with your screen.
		#echo tx 4F:82:10:00 | cec-client -s -d 1
		#echo tx 4F:82:10:00 | cec-client -s -d 1
		#echo tx 4F:82:10:00 | cec-client -s -d 1
